1. Dot notation
const userName = {firstName : "Name"};
console.log(userName.firstName)

2. Bracket Notation(more powerfull)
-- console.log(useName["firstName"]) //object keys are internally strings
-- bracket notation is usefull when key are like 'first-name' or 'first_name'
-- we can also add and access the js variables and expression with it
