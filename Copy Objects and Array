** EVERY CONCEPT BELOW IS NOT IN USE NOW REFER SPREAD OPERATOR FOR THE LATEST ES6 FEATURE FOR COPYING OBJECTS AND ARRAYS


proper way to copy any array oand objects
const fruit = ['','',''];
const newFruit = fruit;

fruit.push('');
here push operation will be done to both  array as it is copy of the fruit array
and both array variable will be pointing to the same address of the element they are consisting

--FOR OBJECTS -- 
const obj1 = {
  firstname:'daniel',
    lastname:"chan"
}
const obj2 = obj1;
obj1.lastname = 'jackson'

--FOR STRINGS--
const Str1 = 'Daniel Mcgregor'
const str2 = Str1;

both (Str1 , str2) the variable will be pointing to the same location where string 'daniel mcgregor' exist in the group of string in the memory

*********RIGHT  WAY  TO COPY OBJECT ****************


--object.assign();--

object.assign(destination_obj , source_obj);
ex. const user1 = {fname:"" , lname:""};
const user2 = {};

object.assign(user2, user1);
address of both objects willbe different
